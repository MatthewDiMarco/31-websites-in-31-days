# 31-websites-in-31-days

The title says it all ;)

# Why?

After feeling inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days](https://jenniferdewalt.com/), i've decided to try something similar in an attempt to develop some much desired front-end expertise. Thus, i'll be making 31 websites across 31 days. The goal here is to develop skills in HTML, CSS and Document manipulation with JavaScript.
No frameworks will be used.
